# Pawer:A Platform to ensure safety around wildlife

## What is Pawer?
Welcome to Pawer, a platform where we work towards the enhancement and security in lifestyle of wild animals so that they can co-exist peacefully with humans. As we know, most of the times there are unexpected break-ins of wild animals at remote areas which lead to havoc due to mutual fear. There are also situations where people are afraid to approach an injured animal for help and they end up unattended. Here we come to play. Our purpose is to minimise the gap that arises due to fear. When a person comes across such a situation, he or she can use our platform to enter the description and contact details after which we will send a SOS along with that person's details and geographical location to the nearest forest department, so that support team can rescue them as soon as possible.
